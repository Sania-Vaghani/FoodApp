# Foodzania Food App

A visually rich and modern food delivery app front-end, designed specifically for iPhone 13 screen dimensions (429x926px). This project features a multi-screen HTML/CSS prototype with custom backgrounds, stylish typography, and numerous food-themed assets.

## Overview
Foodzania is a static HTML/CSS design project for a food delivery application. The UI is tailored for iPhone 13, providing a pixel-perfect preview of a real-world food app experience. The project includes:
- Multiple onboarding, login, and sign-up screens
- Custom backgrounds and logos
- Interactive navigation between screens
- Extensive use of images for food items, banners, and UI elements

---

## Features
- **iPhone 13-specific UI**: All screens use a fixed width (429px) and height (926px) for perfect iPhone 13 emulation.
- **Splash & Logo Animation**: Animated logo intro (see `index.html`).
- **Onboarding Screens**: Delivery intro, get started, login, and sign-up pages (`phone2.html`, `phone3.html`, `phone4.html`, `phone5.html`).
- **Modern Fonts**: Uses Google Fonts (Waterfall, Poppins) for a clean, elegant look.
- **Rich Assets**: Includes dozens of PNG images for food items, backgrounds, banners, and UI icons.
- **Navigation**: Simple navigation using links and JavaScript (`setTimeout` for splash, button navigation for others).

## Main Screens
- **index.html**: Splash/logo page. Animates and redirects to onboarding.
- **phone2.html**: Delivery intro with illustration and "Get Started" button.
